# inEarth - ENVAIRO
inEarth uses temporal data of CO2 concentration to forecast the future concentration of carbon emission. The prediction was conducted using three machine learning algorithms which include ‚ÄòNa√Øve Seasonal Model‚Äô, ‚ÄòLinear regression‚Äô and ‚ÄòTCN Model‚Äô. This methodology was conducted for other data including Air Pollution Index, Sea Level Rise and Increase in global temperature. With this forecasting, this app can graphically visualize the future conditions of a country and global conditions. The visualization enables the user to know the urgency of the climate conditions and habitable risks in a user-friendly method. To make a suitable estimation of actions to counter negative climate conditions inEarth works with the vegetation coverage of a country based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data and predict the required number of greeneries to mitigate the climate issue. The NDVI data will be used to measure current forestry and the number of greeneries in certain locations from imaging. Inspired by Carlson et al. we processed the data using ‚Äòsupervised classification‚Äô to remove clouds and terrain effects [9]. The pixels identifying the steep slope are removed to run the prediction for flat regions. As our solution influences responsible consumption and maintenance of strict government laws inEarth will predict vehicular emissions from spatial data using ‚ÄòSpatiotemporal Graph Convolution Multifusion Network (ST-MFGCN)‚Äô to measure current trend of carbon emissions inspired by Zhenyi Xu et al. [10]. Analysis of quantitative greeneries and vehicular emissions the application provides an estimation of necessary actions that should be taken like carbon tax required tree plantation etc.

### Main

This is the starting point of the application. All the application level configurations are defined in this file i.e, theme, routes, title, orientation etc.

```dart
import 'package:envairo/home_page.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
        appBarTheme: const AppBarTheme(
          color: Color.fromARGB(255, 63, 243, 156),
          titleTextStyle: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)
        ),
        primaryTextTheme: const TextTheme(
          bodyText1: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)
        ),
        textTheme: const TextTheme(
          bodyText1: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)
        )
      ),
      home: const HomePage(),
    );
  }
}
```
